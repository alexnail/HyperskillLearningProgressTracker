<p>In this topic, you will learn about automated <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12640" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, unit testing is the practice of writing and executing tests to verify if the public methods of a unit (typically a class) are working correctly in isolation, without external dependencies such as databases or web services. | These dependencies are tested in integration tests. Unit tests are small, fast, and allow you to test a unit of code independently. However, if your code unit under test depends on external resources, you can use mock objects, which are simulated objects that imitate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way. You can run tests from your IDE or using build tools such as Maven or Gradle. If a test fails, JUnit can show detailed output to help you understand the reason for the test's failure.">unit testing</a> in Java and will write your first unit tests. As you already know, a unit is a piece of code that performs a single task or a unit of work. In Java, in most cases, a unit corresponds to a class. You can write and execute tests to check if the public methods of that unit work correctly.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Note that we use <strong><em>unit</em> </strong>tests to test our application without its <strong><em>external</em></strong> dependencies such as databases, web services, and so on, which falls into the responsibility of <strong><em>integration</em> </strong>tests.</p></div>

<p>In Java, methods may <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12640" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a return value is the result that a method gives after executing its logic. | A method can return a value of a specific data type, or it can return no value, using the void keyword. If a method has a return type, it must include a return statement to provide the result. When invoking a method that returns a value, you can store it in a variable, print it, or pass it as an argument to another method.">return values</a> or change the internal state of objects. So to verify the correctness of any method you may compare the value returned by that method with the expected output or compare the internal state of an object modified by that method with the expected internal state. If you write a bunch of tests covering all execution paths of such a method you can be sure that the method works correctly.</p>
<p>Doing unit testing manually is tedious and time-consuming, especially if it involves manual input from the user. If you have ever tried it, you know it very well. That's why some frameworks provide convenient tools for automated unit testing. The most popular of them is <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JUnit</a>.</p>
<h5 id="getting-started">Getting started</h5>
<p>We are going to use JUnit 5 in this topic since it is the most recent version of the JUnit framework and it supports all features introduced by Java 1.8. This means that JUnit 5 requires Java 8 (or higher) at runtime but also can be used to test code compiled with previous versions of the JDK.</p>
<p>To integrate the JUnit 5 framework into our project, you need to add the required dependencies. If you use <strong>Gradle</strong> as your project build tool, add the following lines to the <code class="language-java">build.gradle</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">dependencies {
    implementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.7.1'
}</code></pre>
<p>where 5.7.1 is the current most recent version of the framework. You always may check <a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">maven central</a> for the most current version of the framework.</p>
<p>Also, to correctly use Gradle with JUnit 5, tell Gradle to use <code class="language-java">JUnitPlatform</code> to run the tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, Gradle will not be able to see your tests and run them.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>Maven</strong>, add the following dependency to <code class="language-java">pom.xml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.junit.jupiter&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;junit-jupiter-engine&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;5.7.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>If you prefer using JUnit 4, you can find respective guidelines and instructions in <a href="https://junit.org/junit4/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the official documentation</a>.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Now, let's create a simple calculator performing basic calculations with integers, which we can easily test. The class <code class="language-java">Calculator</code> has four public methods: <code class="language-java">add</code>, <code class="language-java">subtract</code>, <code class="language-java">multiply</code> and <code class="language-java">divide</code>, each of which takes two integer arguments and returns an integer result of the respective <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12640" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations that can be performed using arithmetic operators. | These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulus or remainder (%) operators. Arithmetic operations take two values or operands, with the exception of unary operators such as unary plus (+) and unary minus (-), which take a single value. The order of operation follows the standard arithmetic rules, with multiplication and division having a higher priority level than addition and subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and for clarity. The unary plus operator indicates a positive value, while the unary minus operator negates a value or an expression.">arithmetic operation</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }

    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    public int divide(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Divisor cannot be zero!");
        }
        return a / b;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Feel free to modify these methods, for example, by adding additional checks to avoid <code class="language-java">int</code> overflow. Later you will be able to write additional tests for such modified methods to build up your skills.</p>
<h5 id="writing-tests">Writing tests</h5>
<p>Now you are ready to write your first test. Let's create a class in our project's <code class="language-java">test/java</code> folder and name it <code class="language-java">CalculatorTests</code>. You may do it manually or, if you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you may right-click on the class name and select <strong>Generate...</strong> and then <strong>Test...</strong> in the drop-down menu to let the IDE create the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12640" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a test class is a crucial component of unit testing in which individual units or components of a software are tested. | It is a class that contains several test methods, each testing a specific functionality of the code. JUnit5, a popular testing framework, creates a new instance of the test class before executing each test method. The test class may contain methods annotated with @BeforeEach and @AfterEach, which are executed before and after each test method, respectively. Additionally, methods annotated with @BeforeAll and @AfterAll are executed once before and after all the test methods, respectively.">test class</a> for you.</p>
<p>Inside the class, add a new method <code class="language-java">testAddition</code> and annotate it with <code class="language-java">@Test</code>. This annotation tells the JUnit framework that the method is a unit test method. Note, that in JUnit5 you don't need the test class or any of the test methods to be public to work properly, so they may be package-private.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class CalculatorTests {

    @Test
    void testAddition() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.add(1, 2);

        assertEquals(3, result);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Inside the test method, we declared an instance of our <code class="language-java">Calculator</code> class and calculated a result of the execution of its <code class="language-java">add</code> method with arguments <code class="language-java">1</code> and <code class="language-java">2</code>. After that we check if the expected result is equal to the actual result, using the <code class="language-java">assertEquals</code> method. It compares the expected value (first argument) and the actual value (second argument) and throws <code class="language-java">AssertionFailedError</code> if they are not equal.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to give your test classes and methods meaningful and descriptive names. If you don't like to use long and hard to read names, you may use <code class="language-java">@DisplayName</code> annotation to declare custom names that will be shown in the test's output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Test
@DisplayName("Add 1 and 2, result should be 3")
void testAddition() {
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    int result = calculator.add(1, 2);

    assertEquals(3, result);
}</code></pre>
<p>Now the line <code class="language-java">"Add 1 and 2, result should be 3"</code> will be displayed in the test output instead of the test <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12640" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a method name is an identifier that is used to uniquely identify a method within a class. | It is specified during the method declaration and is used to call or invoke the method. The method name, along with its parameter list in parentheses, forms the method signature. Method names should be descriptive and follow the naming conventions of starting with a lowercase letter and using camelCase for multiple words. They can include letters, digits, and the underscore character, but cannot start with a digit. A method name is a legal identifier in Java.">method name</a>. This is very convenient if you want to provide some additional information about the test case or the expected value.</p>
<h5 id="assertions">Assertions</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-java">Assertions</code> class of JUnit framework has a lot of overloaded <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12640" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an assertion is a method used to enforce invariants, check method preconditions and postconditions, and ensure that a certain condition is met before or after a method is invoked. | The key limitation when using assertions is that they should never produce side effects and change the way a program operates. This means that the assertion should not affect a program in any way other than throwing an error. Assertions can be written using various libraries such as AssertJ, which provides a fluent API with a wide range of built-in assertion methods. AssertJ also allows you to perform custom assertions or a series of assertions on an object using a lambda expression, a method reference, or an anonymous inner class.">assertion methods</a> that allow you to test different conditions. Here are some useful assertions:</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><code class="language-java">assertEquals</code></p></td><td><p>tests if the arguments are equal</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-java">assertTrue</code></p></td><td><p>tests if the argument is <code class="language-java">true</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-java">assertFalse</code></p></td><td><p>tests if the argument is <code class="language-java">false</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-java">assertNull</code></p></td><td><p>tests if the argument is <code class="language-java">null</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-java">assertNotNull</code></p></td><td><p>tests if the argument is not <code class="language-java">null</code></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code class="language-java">assertThrows</code></p></td><td><p>tests if the argument throws a certain exception</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>All of them have overloaded versions which accept a message of the <code class="language-java">String</code> type that will be displayed if the test fails. You may find detailed descriptions of these and the other assertion methods in the <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Assertions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official JUnit 5 documentation</a>.</p>
<h5 id="running-tests">Running tests</h5>
<p>Now we have a few unit tests which we may run. You may run unit tests by opening the <code class="language-java">CalculatorTests</code> file and click the green <strong>Run</strong> button in the gutter or by right-clicking on this file in the project view panel and selecting <strong>Run 'CalculatorTests'</strong> in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Another way to run the tests is to run them using Gradle. First, let's add the following lines to the <code class="language-java">build.gradle</code> file so we can see more detailed output for executed tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">test {

    testLogging {
        events "passed", "skipped", "failed"
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>After that, run the following command in the terminal in the project root directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">./gradlew test</code></pre>
<p>Once the tests are executed, you will see this is the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; Task :test
CalculatorTests &gt; testMultiplication() PASSED
CalculatorTests &gt; Add 1 and 2, result should be 3 PASSED
CalculatorTests &gt; testDivisionByZero() PASSED
CalculatorTests &gt; testDivision() PASSED
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s</code></pre>
<p>The output shows the task that has been executed, the names of all tests, and the status of their execution.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Note that if a test method has an empty body it will be counted as <code class="language-java">PASSED</code>. If you want to force your test to fail, you have to invoke the <code class="language-java">fail</code> method inside it.</p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="test-outcomes">Test outcomes</h5>
<p>Let's create a unit test for another method. But first, we are going to change our <code class="language-java">multiply</code> method to introduce a bug in its implementation and make it return zero for any arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is the code of the respective test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Test
void testMultiplication() {
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    int result =  calculator.multiply(2, 3);

    assertEquals(6, result);
}</code></pre>
<p>Run the tests again using the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">./gradlew test</code></pre>
<p>The new test fails as expected:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; Task :test FAILED
CalculatorTests &gt; testDivision() PASSED
CalculatorTests &gt; Add 1 and 2, result should be 3 PASSED
CalculatorTests &gt; testMultiplication() FAILED
    org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError at CalculatorTests.java:38
CalculatorTests &gt; testDivisionByZero() PASSED
4 tests completed, 1 failed</code></pre>
<p>The output shows that <code class="language-java">testMultiplication</code> failed with <code class="language-java">AssertionFailedError</code> at line 38 in <code class="language-java">CalculatorTests.java.</code> Now let's go to the faulty method, fix the bug by making <code class="language-java">multiply</code> to return a product of its arguments instead of zero, and re-run the tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; Task :test
CalculatorTests &gt; testMultiplication() PASSED
CalculatorTests &gt; Add 1 and 2, result should be 3 PASSED
CalculatorTests &gt; testDivisionByZero() PASSED
CalculatorTests &gt; testDivision() PASSED</code></pre>
<p>Excellent! The bug is gone and all tests are successfully passed so we may be sure that our calculator works correctly.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Please note that <code class="language-java">gradle test</code> runs each test only one time per change. If you execute this command again, there will be no output of test results. If you want to run all tests, including successfully passed and unchanged, use the following command: <code class="language-java">gradle cleanTest test</code>.</p></div>
